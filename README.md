 // Brief Description of what you did. 
 In this project, I created a Pokémon search app that allows users to search for Pokémon by name or ID and view detailed information such as type, abilities, moves, and evolution chain. Users can also add Pokémon to their favorites, with the list stored in local storage for persistence across sessions. The app utilizes React, Next.js, and the PokeAPI to fetch and display Pokémon data dynamically.
